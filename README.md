Classification and Segmentation with Deep Learning in PyTorch utilizing WandB and Hydra 


## Setup

```bash
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Next Steps:
1. Resnet 18 + Erase for less overfitting
2. Resnet 18 + Shorter LR Schedule (about half)
3. Resnet 34 -> see how bad overfitting gets
4. Try different encoders (mobilenet, convnext, resnext, wide_resnet, ...) and compare accuracy at steps and training duration
